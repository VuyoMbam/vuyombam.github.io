```{python}
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Compute project root (one level up from articles/)
project_root = Path.cwd().parents[0]
if str(project_root) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))
```


## Motivation

Coal plant closures are often discussed in terms of capacity and emissions, but
their employment impacts are poorly quantified.

This article applies an input–output framework to estimate direct and indirect
job effects under alternative retirement scenarios.

## Methodology

We use sectoral operating expenditure data mapped to 22 economic commodity classes.

```{python}
from site_utils import plotly_theme, export
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd
import os

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Year": [2025, 2030, 2035],
    "Jobs": [12000, 8000, 3000]
})

fig = px.line(df, x="Year", y="Jobs", title="Estimated Employment Impact")

export.save_preview(fig)

fig.show()
```
